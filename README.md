## Requirements

Your repository should include the following:

1. **Rust Application**

   - A simple application built in Rust that demonstrates your ability to use Rust effectively.
   - Incorporate Spice.ai OSS to enhance your application's functionality.

2. **One or More `spicepod.yml` Files**

   - Define your data connectors, embeddings, and models using `spicepod.yml`.
   - Ensure your Spicepods are well-structured and documented.

3. **Documentation**

   - Provide clear documentation explaining:
     - The purpose of your application.
     - How to build and run it.
     - Any dependencies or setup instructions.
     - An explanation of your Spicepods.
     - Any credentials required.

4. **GitHub Issues for Project Management**
   - Use GitHub Issues to track your project's tasks and progress.
   - Include meaningful commit messages linked to your issues.
